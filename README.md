## Article Tracker

- Helpful tool to gather research articles and info on them. 
- Created a database using MongoDB with a database schema (i.e., title, review, date) using Mongoose
- Added API endpoints to the server to handle HTTP GET or POST requests for article info
- Installed Axios library to send HTTP requests to the backend allowing the creation, editing, and deletion of new articles

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
